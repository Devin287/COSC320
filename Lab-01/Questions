Question 1: The algorithm ends when the outer most for loop reaches the 
		center of the array and swaps those elements to the correct
		position.

Queestion 2: I think the time complexity is the same as selection sort because
		it does as many swaps and comparisons as it. They both go through
		the array but double ended sorts the second half of the array at 
		the same time as the first because it dins the max and min. I think
		this could be better than selction sort even though it has the same time
		complexity. In certain situations that one or both end(s) of the array is mostly 			sorted the algorithm will perform faster because it will do less 
		swaps and comparisons.
